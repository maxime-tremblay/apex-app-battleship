#Battleship
##Description
The application is a single and multi-player battleship game entirely made with Oracle Application Express 5.0. 
The game is played on four grids, two for each player. The grids are 10Ã—10. On one grid the player arranges ships and records of the opponent's shots is shown. On the other grid records of the player's shots are shown.

Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player.

| Type of ship | Size |
| :----------- | :--: |
| Carrier      | 5    |
| Battleship   | 4    |
| Submarine    | 3    |
| Cruiser      | 3    |
| Destroyer    | 2    |

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to select a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. If the targeted square in the opponent's grid is occupied by a ship, it's marked as a hit (red square), otherwise, it's marked as a miss (blue square).

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.

This game was designed and built to be part of the [ODTUG APEX Gaming Competition 2015](http://competition.odtug.com/).
